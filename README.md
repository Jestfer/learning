Getting 1% better at Software Engineering everyday

The purpose of this repository is to put together resources I've gone through to level up as a software engineer.

This is also my [Learn-In-Public Journal](https://github.com/Jestfer/learning/tree/master/journal).

Inspired by [amitness](https://github.com/amitness/learning), [chiubaca](https://github.com/chiubaca/learning), [No Zero Days](https://medium.com/@fayadh56/the-concept-of-no-more-zero-days-and-why-motivation-is-fleeting-9c1c307f8948) and [swyx, author of "The Coding Career Handbook"](https://www.swyx.io/)
