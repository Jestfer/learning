# AWS Fundamentals: Going Cloud-Native

## Introduction, Infrastructure and Compute

#### Overview of AWS

**What is Cloud Computing?**

Getting the right services (compute power, storage, apps...) with pay-as-you-go pricing. Some key benefits are:

- No more guessing capacity
- Increase speed
- No money on running/maintaining data centers
- Deploy globally in minutes

**Infrastructure**

- Many regions all over the world, these are self-contained and have all assets needed to run applications
- A region is comprised of multiple isolated locations (Availability Zones), which are connected in case a disaster happens to one or a few of them
- Things to consider when using different regions for our services: latency, compliance, pricing, if new services are available...
