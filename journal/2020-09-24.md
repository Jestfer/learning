# Part 2: Establishing a Pipeline

- Skimmed through Chapter 6 (Embracing the New Development Life Cycle): from a line (Waterfall) to a circuit (Agile - DevOps), in which steps that came too late in Waterfall are included earlier on in the SDLC, for example Testing.
- Skimmed through Chapter 7 (Planning Ahead): planning, requirements, MVP, personas to identify customers.
- Skipping some chapters to go to the specific ones I want to go through at the moment
