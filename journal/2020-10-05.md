# Docker 101 Tutorial

Multi-Container Apps => In general, each container should do one thing and do it well.

- Important: containers normally run in isolation, they do NOT know anything about other containers or processes on the same machine. We have **Container Networking** to allow them to talk to each other. If 2 containers are on the same network, they can talk to each other, if not, they can't.

1. Create the network => docker network create todo-app
2. Start the MySQL container and attach the network, passing some [environment variables to initialize DB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/)
3. Confirm DB is up and running on created container

Before connecting the DB to the TODO App, we'll use a great tool for troubleshooting or debugging networking issues: [nicolaka/netshoot](https://github.com/nicolaka/netshoot) - Service discovery using DNS

- We just need to start a new container using the nicolaka/netshoot image (IMPORTANT: use the same network as defined above => todo-app)
- We run dig mysql (network alias we used before) to see if Docker can find that hostname for the container we launched before

Now, let's connect MySQL with the TODO App:

1. Start the Todo App container on 3000, attaching it to todo-app network and passing the env variables needed for MySQL (better to use secrets in Production)
2. Add a few Todos
3. Connect to the DB container and see entries on todo table

Next: Docker Compose to share app stacks much easier and let others spin up with a quick and simple command (e.g. Scary Monster)
