Image Building Best Practices

1. Image layering

- docker image history to see the different layers within an image

2. Layer Caching

- once a layer changes, all downstream layers need to be recreated as well!
- does not make sense that for every app change (hence creating a new image) we have to redo the dependency install step over and over again => SO, we cache the dependencies

3. Multi-Stage Builds

- reduce overall image size and increase final container security by separating build-time dependencies from runtime ones

IMPORTANT: a key idea to takeaway is that we can build images faster and ship fewer changes
