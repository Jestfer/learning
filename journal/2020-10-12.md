# Play with Docker - Application Containerization and Microservice Orchestration

4. Redis Service for Caching

- Now API service will talk to Redis to avoid downloading/parsing pages that are already in cache (hence saving resources)
- We run another container for Redis
- Monitor Redis using redis-cli to see how it caches info for pages visited the first time

5. Swapping services in the MS architecture - Python API service with Ruby

- App still functions swapping these, nothing surprising.
- Added logging functionality to the Ruby app to log when cache is HIT/MISS - site has been visited/not visited before

Recap:

- Docker Compose to orchestrate app stack
  - Good for Development Environment
  - Bad for Production Environment => example task: deploy + run same app in a Docker Swarm Cluster (docker stack deploy)
