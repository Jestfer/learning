# AWS Fundamentals: Going Cloud-Native

## Networking and Storage on AWS

#### Networking on AWS

**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Notation

- Important concept in networking on AWS
- CIDR network addresses are allocated in a VPC and in a subnet by using CIDR notation (/16 or /24 block)

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- Isolated section to launch resources in a virtual network
- We have full control over network env:
  - own IP ranges
  - own subnets created
  - config of route tables
  - own network gateways - Internet Gateway (IGW) | there's also Private Gateway (PGW)

Subnets

- Basically a subset of IP ranges for a VPC
- After creating a VPC, we can add 1+ subnets in different Availability Zones (AZ)
- We specify CIDR block for subnet
- Security is provided using Security Groups (more info in AWS Security)
