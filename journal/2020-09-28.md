## Containers: Much More than Virtual Machines

- Images are immutable, allow containers to be created using refs to shared info. E.g. 2 containers that are very similar: use same base image and change only what's different
- Containers have isolated CPU, memory and other resources. They hold source code, system tools and libs. A container is usually referred to as a lightweight virtual machine (VM).
- MS as an ideal architecture for containers
- Orchestrators to create, manage and update containers across multiple hosts: “An orchestrator is essentially a manager that you can use to automatically scale (add additional resources) your cluster with multiple instances of each image, instantiate new containers, suspend or kill instances when required, and control each container’s access to resources such as storage and secrets.” Kubernetes is a popular option.
- Containers are:
  - Temporary
  - Immutable
  - Scalable
  - Lacking persistent storage (app data is not stored in the service container)
