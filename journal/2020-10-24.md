## Gatsby

### Data in Gatsby

- Data as everything that lives outside a React component
- Can use node createPages API for simple sites (TAKE A LOOK!!!!) or use GraphQL for more complex sites.

#### First GraphQL query

- siteMetadata object in gatsby config js file for common bits of data in app
- page queries only available on page components
- StaticQuery for non-page components (layout component) to retrieve data using GraphQL queries
- Philosohpy of changing things in one place and components reacting to that change without having to change all of them one by one

- GraphiQL => GraphQL IDE

#### Source Plugins

- Data in Gatsby sites can come from anywhere: APIs, databases, CMSs, local files, etc.
- Source plugins fetch data from their source (filesystem plugin for filesystem, WP plugin from WordPress API...)

#### Building pages with GraphQL query

- Normally, first we play with GraphiQL to sketch out data query, then copy it to React page component to start building the UI

Summary: Source Plugins bring data into Gatsby, then next we will see transformer plugins to transform raw content brought by source plugins
