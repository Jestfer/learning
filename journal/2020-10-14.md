# AWS Fundamentals: Going Cloud-Native

## Introduction, Infrastructure and Compute

#### Compute

**Compute Services**

- AWS has lots of compute services to develop, deploy, run and scale apps

Key services for serverless computing and containers:

AWS Lambda (only one always free it seems)

- Run code without provisioning or managing servers
- Pay only for compute time consumed, no charge if code is not running

AWS Container Services - Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)

- Container Orchestration that supports Docker containers (Highly scalable and performant)
- Run and scale containerized apps on AWS

There are others like:

- Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS)
- AWS Fargate...
