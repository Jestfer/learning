# Part 1: Demystifying DevOps

- Skimmed through Chapter 1 (Introducing DevOps) and Chapter 2 (Designing Your Organization). These chapters are not meant to provide practical and applicable knowledge, but to explain what is DevOps and what problems it solves.
- Read Chapter 3 (Identifying Waste), main takeaways:
  - There are 7 types of waste, ordered from most-to-least impactful: Unnecessary process, Waiting, Motion, Costs of defects, Overproduction, Transportation and Inventory. The idea is to identify any potential waste, which creates bottlenecks in the Software Delivery Life Cycle (SDLC), and tackle them through optimization and simplification.
  - Habit is the worst enemy of efficiency: "We've always done it this way." poisons fresh ideas at the root.
  - Short-term bottlenecks (most reliable engineer on holidays) and long-term bottlenecks (slow pipelines/machines).
  - Focus on impact: to solve bottlenecks, there are some options: more employees, eliminate unnecessary activities, provide a buffer (async work, other tasks to work on when "waiting"). Also, train engineers on all aspects of process (e2e).
- Skimmed through Chapter 4 (Persuading Colleagues to Try DevOps) and Chapter 5 (Measuring Your Organization).
