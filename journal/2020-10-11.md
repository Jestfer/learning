# Play with Docker - Application Containerization and Microservice Orchestration

1. Containerized Link Extractor Script

- Basically created a Dockerfile to prepare a Docker image for the Python script/app to be executed in a container with the needed base image from Python and also the dependencies and permissions needed on script

2. Run API service container listening on port 5000 (detached '-d' mode, mapping 5000:5000)

3. Linking Extractor API and Web Frontend services

- For containers to be able to talk to each other, we have two ways:
  - Mapping their ports on host machine and use that to request routing; OR even better
  - Place them in a single private network - containers discover others then using their names as hostnames (no IP address hunting!)

We use Docker Compose to build and run both containers

And this is an application with Microservice (MS) architecture (as opposed to Monolithic).

- Easier to scale, maintain and move around

As we had the ./www folder bind mounted in the container, we make changes to it on host machine running the container and these are reflected there instantly, as we've seen before.

- This is useful in development, but in production it's a better practice for Docker images to be self-contained (CI/CD to deploy new ones, running all the stages needed and making sure it's all good)
