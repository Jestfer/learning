What Next? Container Orchestration

- Ochestrators (e.g. Kubernetes) solve issues like: dead containers, scaling...
- Orchestrators are like managers that receive **expected state** => e.g. running 2 instances of the app and expose port 80. Orchestrator look at all the machines in the cluster and delegate tasks to workers (nodes)
- Orchestrators watch for changes (container ending) and start necessary tasks to accomplish expected state
