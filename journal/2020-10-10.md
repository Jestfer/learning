# Play with Docker - Docker for Beginners

Packaging apps as Docker Images through a Dockerfile

- Built an image with a simple app
- Run a new container that runs the Nginx server with the newly generated image (flag --publish 80:80 to do the mapping on port 80 of container to port 80 of host)
- Using a bind mount to allow for changes on host machine to be reflected on a container running on the same machine => IF NOT, then we would have to stop the container with the app, make changes, rebuild the image and run the container again
- Built new version of app image to persist changes
- Two containers cannot map to the same port of a single Docker host, so we publish one container on 80:80 and the other on 8080:80 (we'll open the new version of the app on port 80 of the host and the old one on 8080)
