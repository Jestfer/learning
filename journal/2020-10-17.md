# AWS Fundamentals: Going Cloud-Native

## Networking and Storage on AWS

#### Storage on AWS

IMPORTANT: object storage (can't be partially modified: e.g. images...) vs block storage (can be partially modified: e.g. data with different fields)

**Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)**

- Persistent block storage volumes to use with Amazon EC2 instances
- ONLY attaches to an EC2 instance at a time
- Different options

**Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)**

- To store data (as objects) within resources called _buckets_
- Unlimited bucket size, but object limited to 5 TB
- Access control to buckets and objects within it
- Often used to save backups (high durability)

**Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)**

- Can attach to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously (including instances on different VPCs)
- Good for example for corporate directory where everyone connects to same filestore
