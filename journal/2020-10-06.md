# Docker 101 Tutorial

Docker Compose

- A big advatange of using it is that the app stack can be defined in a file at the root of the project repo, enabling people to contribute to the project.

We need to define the compose file with the compose version we want to use and then add the services, volumes, etc.

- Then we run docker-compose up -d (flag to run in the background, detached mode), which will create the containers for the different apps in the stack
- By default, Docker Compose creates a network for the app stack, so we do not need to specify it on the .yml file
- By default, volumes defined in the compose .yml are NOT removed when running _docker-compose down_, we need to add the _--volumes_ flag
