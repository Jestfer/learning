## Gatsby

- Built quick prototype app with Gatsby and read through the official docs, key considerations:

- Same philosohpy as Next.js regarding using React components:

  - self-contained units that couple JS, CSS and HTML
  - each React component describes a section of the UI
  - these accept some input and return React elements

- As in Next.js, any React component within src/pages becomes a page
- src/components to reuse pieces across pages (same as Next.js, again)

#### Deploying a Gatsby Site

- As Gatsby is a _Modern Site Generator_, there are no servers or DBs to set up
- **gatsby build** creates a folder of static HTML and JS files to deploy to a static site hosting service

#### Styling

- global styles file import in gatsby-browser.js (project root)
- Component-scoped CSS (modular CSS to style in a component-oriented way)
  - CSS Modules (\*.module.css => tells Gatsby to process CSS file as a CSS Module and not plain CSS)
  - CSS-in-JS (Emotion and Styled Components are common)

#### Plugins

- Install + Configure plugins to extend on current app functionality (hundreds of plugings in the Gatsby plugin lib)
- gatsby-config.js => add plugins and other site config here

#### Layout Components

- Just a Parent common component to reuse code across different children
- Example case: Layout Component with footer/header that is used in Homepage, About Us, Contact... (these are passed as props)
