# Play with Docker

We can use containers in different ways:

1. To run a single task => shell script or custom app
2. Interactively => connect to container similarly as SSH into a remote server (e.g. CircleCI build debugging)
3. In the background (most often used) => long-running services (website or DB)

Run an example for each of these types

Next: packaging apps as Docker images
