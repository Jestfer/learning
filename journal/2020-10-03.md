# Docker 101 Tutorial

- Each container has its own "scratch space" to create/update/remove files, so a file that is in one container won't be available in another even if using the same image to build it
- We need to use Container Volumes to connect specific filesystem paths of the container back to the host machine so that it's available for the next container
- There are two main types of volumes - _named volumes_ and _bind mounts_: we will start with named volumes
- To create a volume, we need to run => docker volume create todo-db
- Then we need to start the app container with the volume flag => docker run -dp 3000:3000 -v todo-db:/etc/todos "APP IMAGE TAG"
- We can inspect the created volume to get more info on the host machine => docker volume inspect todo-db

Next: using bind mounts to avoid rebuilding images for every change
